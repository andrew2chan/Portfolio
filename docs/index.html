          <div class="col-sm-6 descriptions">Tabletop Games is a 3D board and card game simulator. This web app features:
            <br><br>
            <ul>
              <li>The ability to login and register</li>
              <li>A win and loss tracker</li>
              <li>Card game war with an AI</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In terms of the technology - the MEAN stack was used for tor the front and backend. MongoDB (Mlabs) is used as the database to store login information and lifetime stats. Express is used as the middleware to simplify NodeJS. AngularJS is used for a smooth and seamless SPA experience and lastly, NodeJS is used for the server.</p>
            <p>Additionally, for the game itself - we utilized three.js to create the game, scene and animations.</p>
            <p>This was an academic project created for my course, CPS630 (Web apps). I was responsible for most of the front and the backend as well as assigning, monitoring and integrating other members code into the main branch and deploying to heroku.</p>

            <p>VR archery is an archery simulation that allows the user to practice their aim in a game environment. The simulation/game will include tower defence elements, which would include mobs (moving targets with hitboxes) with health, towers that attack them, goal for the mobs would an entry point of which once they pass the playerâ€™s health point will drop by 1. </p>
            <p>Utilized C# and Unity3D to develop this game.</p>
            <p>An academic project created for my course, CPS841 (VR). My partner and I split the work 50/50 and we were both responsible for various parts throughtout the project. In addition to regular coding, I also learned and used a bit of Blender in order to generate 3D models to be used in game. The models include some glaciers as well as some towers.</p>
            <p>Below is a link to the site with some screenshots as well as a video demo of the game.</p>
